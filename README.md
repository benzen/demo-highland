demo-highland
==============

Goal
======
This project only aims at trying [highland.js](http://highlandjs.org/).

Why
===========
I was looking into FRP (Fonctional Reactive programming), espacially [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).
When I discovered highland. Having used [Async.JS](https://github.com/caolan/async) it
made a lot more sens to me than the idea of RxJs. So let it try out.
